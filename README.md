# url_shortener

As you know URL shortener help to reduce the length of the URL so that it can be shared easily on platforms, where a number of characters are an issue. 
There are many URL Shorteners available in the market today. But I've built my own tiny url shortner in python. 

There are 2 Python files, one for Bit.ly the other is for pyshortener. 
Both of them are quite useful, but for Bit.ly version you'll need unique token. 
Furthermore it Bit.ly version has special abilities. You can analyze how many clicks were to your short link. 

For using pyshortener version you must install pyshortener `pip install pyshorteners`

For using Bit.ly version:

Download the Bitly API module from the following link: https://github.com/bitly/bitly-api-python. 
To download the API module, press the green button: Clone or download (on the right), and afterwards, press Download ZIP
Unzip the downloaded folder into the project directory and navigate into the folder bitly-api-python-master by entering cd bitly-api-python-master.
Install the bitly_api module by entering the command into the terminal: python setup.py install.
In the terminal, enter your Python shell by entering the command python and afterwards, enter import bitly_api. 
If there are no errors, the module was successfully installed (ignore syntax warnings).
Run your code again and it should work.
